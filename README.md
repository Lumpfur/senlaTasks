thats bout my experience from trying to get senlas education track

First of all, thanks for that experience, thats a nice way to improve my skills in java.
Now about the second task: i thought about: how to show my interest in those spheres, and i decided 
to do something better and more usefull: a real converter of values (from ru) using the parser from Central Bank website (using JSON files to parse) 
without maven-build project (cause i didnt want to build all tasks on maven). 
I serfed the whole gitHub and searched the nice one example to took apart as an example (also i used Stack Overflow).
